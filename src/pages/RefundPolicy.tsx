              <h2 className="legal-section-title">B. Refund in case of Deprovisioning of Services</h2>
              <p className="legal-text">
                All Services shall be presumed to be in an active state and shall be billed till the date of de-provisioning of respective Services. The Customer is required to follow the below process for making any de-provisioning request:
              </p>
              <ul className="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Services availed through Self Service Portal:</strong> The Services availed by you via self-service portal accessible at https://myaccount.projectx38.com can be de-provisioned by you by making a request through the self-service portal. For termination of the Services, the Customer can follow the steps mentioned in help article available at link https://docs.projectx38.com/nodes/managenode.html.</li>
                <li><strong>Services Provisioned Manually:</strong> Where Services have been provisioned manually by our team on your request, you shall have to explicitly file a request for de-provisioning of the Services by sending an email to us at cloud-platform@projectx38.com specifying explicitly the date of de-provisioning. Such request shall be treated as valid only if sent through your authorized technical contact and the de-provisioning shall have to be unconditional.</li>
                <li>On receiving your request for de-provisioning of Service(s), our provisioning team will de-provision that/those Service(s) and send you and the X38 finance team a de-provisioning mail ("De-provisioning Email"). We will cease billing for that/those service(s) from the effective de-provisioning date mentioned in the De-Provisioning Email, which is copied to our finance team.</li>
                <li>In case our finance team inadvertently misses accounting for a De-provisioning Email and has billed you for the de-provisioned services, we shall rectify the error by issuing a credit note or infra credits, on receipt of an email to that effect from you. To enable us to do the same we request you to email us at billing-support@projectx38.com notifying us of the error along with the details of the appropriate De-provisioning Email received from provisioning@projectx38.com detailing the de-provisioning request.</li>
                <li>The billing period for Services includes the day of provisioning and the day of de-provisioning and all the days in between these two dates. All manually provisioned services including virtual/dedicated compute nodes are billed in advance as per the monthly billing cycle (unless you have specifically requested for a longer billing cycle).</li>
                <li>If you request us to de-provision any manually provisioned service before the end of its billing cycle, we may, at our discretion, issue equivalent credit note or infra credits or refund the remaining amount charged in advance in full minus any payment gateway transaction charges to the source through which payment was received earlier. Alternatively, if you continue to avail other services that are still in the provisioned state, the remaining amount may be adjusted in the next billing cycle.</li>

                The software licenses billed by us are billed for each calendar month regardless of the period of usage during the month. Once a software license has been used during a calendar month, it is NOT eligible for a refund and you will be charged for the full monthly cost of that license. Refund of software license cost paid for unused future months is however possible, on receipt of an email from you to us at billing-support@projectx38.com requesting the same.
